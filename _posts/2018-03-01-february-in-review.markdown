It feels like this month lasted about 47 seconds, but here we are! I want to take a minute to reflect on my February so stick around for some life updates. :)

Classes are in full swing now, and I'm enjoying all of them except for physics. Physics and me are not friends. I'm absolutely fascinated by my data structures and algorithms class, even though the homeworks are tedious. So if anyone needs to implement a linked list or build a binary search tree, I'm your girl! I'm also learning how to build an android app from scratch in my objects and design class, which is a partnership with CS + Social Good to create an app that helps homeless people find shelters.

I found roommates and an airbnb for my summer in San Francisco!! I can't wait to start my internship and go hiking at national parks on the weekends.
