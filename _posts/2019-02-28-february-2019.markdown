### Adventures This Month







I was pretty boring this month tbh but let's get into it. 







  * I went to Amelie's with Rachel, drank four shots of espresso in like 20 minutes, and then worked on a CS2200 project at rapid speed for 5 hours yikes but I built a processor that runs assembly code!!

  * I went to Pearl Hacks, an all-female hackathon at UNC Chapel Hill, we didn't demo and left early but we snagged a ton of free food so worth it

  * Valentines Day!! We had a picnic at Piedmont with all the essentials (basically just a ton of cheese and bread and jam lol) and then drank a bottle of incredible sparkling ros√©. I feel very lucky and very loved <3
