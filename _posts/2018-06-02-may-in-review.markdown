### Important Life Updates





	
  * Alex graduated from Georgia Tech!

	
  * Hannah graduated from high school! (I think I will be laughing about this picture for the rest of my life)![34399632_Unknown.JPG](https://paigecodes13.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/34399632_unknown.jpg)

	
  * I started my Google internship! My start date was May 21, I'll be working as a EP intern for the next 12 weeks. I'm working on the Android Google Search App (AGSA) team, specifically on how the app handles users with low or unreliable internet connectivity. I'm very excited to learn as much as possible about working in the tech industry and android development over the next three months.

	
  * I moved to San Francisco! I'm living in an airbnb with two other interns, with a view of the Bay Bridge that takes my breath away every time I walk out the front door
