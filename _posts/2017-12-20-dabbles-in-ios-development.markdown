It only took about four days of winter break for me to start getting a little bit stir-crazy with no school work to do. As a productive solution to my boredom, I decided to delve into learning how to create an iOS app. I have to admit that my today's dabbles were little more than copying code from tutorials into Xcode, but I have to start somewhere. The screenshots below are from Xcode's IPhone8+ simulator running my app.

The Hello World app I created was a simple introduction to Swift and coding in Xcode. The tutorial I used can be found at https://www.appcoda.com/learnswift/build-your-first-app.html.
