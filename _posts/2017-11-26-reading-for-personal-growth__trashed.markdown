I'm an avid reader. I consider speed-reading to be one of my greatest academic strengths, and that comes from years of reading constantly. In my free time, and sometimes as an escape when I have no free time, I turn to books for new knowledge, minds to jump into, and worlds to explore. I read my textbooks for clarity on lecture material and coding interview books to get ahead as a computer science job candidate, but I've learned that I am my happiest self when I also make time to read fictional novels that fuel my imagination. Pictured below are the books I read during my six weeks studying abroad in Oxford over the summer, and I've read countless others since then.Â ![IMG_1563](https://paigecodes13.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_1563.jpg)
