Earlier this month the first picture of a black hole was constructed using computer science!! The work that Katie Bouman and her team are doing is really interesting, you can watch her TED Talk [here](https://www.ted.com/talks/katie_bouman_what_does_a_black_hole_look_like?language=en).

I went to Mrs. Miller's Sugar-Coated exhibit at the Besharat Contemporary. It was a great experience full of deep conversations and wonderful friends. See the picture above for a sculpture that we all think looks just like Matt. Thank you for inviting me Tom, I'm so proud of you Mrs. Miller!!







#### Girls Who COde Conference

Throughout this semester I have been helping to plan and organize volunteers for a Girls Who Code Conference. A few weeks ago the event finally happened, and it was a great success! Helping to plan this event and then getting to work with high school girls who attended was an incredibly rewarding experience. It reminded me of how I found my passion for computer science, and I saw that same fire in the eyes of these students as they learned about robotics, cyber security, artificial intelligence, and much more.  I love being apart of Girls Who Code at Georgia Tech, and I'm excited to see it grow next year with Bura as our new President.   








#### Dear Evan Hansen

I saw Dear Evan Hansen at the Fox Theater!! Lauren and I had pit seats in the very first row of the theater. I've loved this musical since I first heard the soundtrack, and may or may not have had my alarm set to sing me the line "today's going to be a great day, and here's why, because today at least you're you, and that's enough" every morning for the past year. Seeing the musical live was an incredible experience.

All of my friends are killing it at life right now, but one of my friends constantly inspires me with her ambition, leadership, and dedication to making the world a better place. My roommate, Rachel Raisin, is the director of TedX Georgia Tech and will be interning for Microsoft in Seattle this summer. I'm so proud of her and excited to see all the incredible things she's going to do next. I love you Rachel!!.
