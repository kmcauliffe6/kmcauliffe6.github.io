Hello friends!

There's something that I need to tell you. Something that I have been dancing around since I was fourteen. I have come out to some of you in a variety of ways: as a terrified high school freshman when a friend betrayed my trust, as a high school junior with a college essay, as a giddy college freshman who couldn't shut up about her first kiss. In parked cars, at sleepovers, by kissing my girlfriend in public and hoping that people would get the point, I have let myself be vulnerable and grown more confident with each confession. But I've never explicitly shared it on social media. For my own emotional well-being, I need to rip this bandaid off.

I'm gay.

Fourteen-year-old Paige is screaming at me to close this browser and stop over-sharing this top-secret, diary-that-I-have-to-hide-under-my-bed type of info immediately, but I'm ignoring her. I think she's secretly proud of me for doing what she couldn't.

One of my favorite TED talks is Brené Brown's "The Power of Vulnerability”. In her speech, Brown says that "_you cannot selectively numb emotion...You can't numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects, our emotions. You cannot selectively numb. So when we numb those, we numb joy, we numb gratitude, we numb happiness._" This struck a chord with me because I've spent a significant portion of my life attempting to numb the feelings that I have for women. I put walls up that kept my emotions guarded. It's time to tear them down.

I want to stress that I'm happy. Today I'm walking with Google in the San Francisco pride parade, and I'm radiantly joyful to be alive and twirling in a rainbow cape. I've grown into this identity and I have never felt more comfortable in my own skin. I want to share that with all of you.

I hope that those of you reading this can understand that I am exactly the same person that I was before you read this. The only thing that has changed is your perception of me. I will not shrink myself or hide my true feelings for someone else's comfort ever again.

Thank you for reading this. I hope that it can bring us closer and not tear us apart.

Love,

Paige
