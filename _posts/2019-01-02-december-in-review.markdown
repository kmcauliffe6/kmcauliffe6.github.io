Hi pals! 







In January I decided that my new years resolution would be to keep track of my adventures and progress throughout the year, and I chose this blog as the medium to do that. So, for the first time in my life, I can say that I kept a new year's resolution for the whole year :)







I feel like I really grew into myself this year, looking through these posts and thinking back at my actual life, I'm proud of myself. I'm proud of the person that I am becoming.   








Anyways, you can click through old posts so I'm not going to list the highlights, even though it's super tempting to because I really loved my life this year! I'm so grateful to have friends and family that care about me enough to read these. Without further ado, please enjoy my last monthly review of 2018!!
