**I competed in the #CodeLikeAWoman Challenge in Chicago**  







In mid-September I completed a HackerRank online challenge that tested data structures knowledge. I placed in the top 40 and won a flight to Chicago to compete in a hackathon with the other top contestants. My team didn't win but it was a great experience and I learned a lot. I also got to visit with Emily, Mallory, and Kaylee while I was in Chicago <3
