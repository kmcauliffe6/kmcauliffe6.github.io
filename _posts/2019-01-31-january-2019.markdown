#### I WON A HACKATHON







Lauren, Matt, Rachel and I competed in the Collegiate Cup last weekend. We got put in the design category, which none of us have any experience with so it was a bit of a mess but we learned so much. We met some incredible mentors, sacrificed sleep for brainstorming sessions, and created a prototype for a multi-platform workbook that empowers kindergarten to second-grade girls to learn computer science concepts. We placed first in our category which is still crazy to think about. We actually might pursue a startup with our idea so stay tuned!!
